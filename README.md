### What I learned

- Integrating with external APIs (GitHub API) to fetch real-time user and repository data
- Building a responsive React application with TypeScript for type safety
- Managing async operations and loading states with React hooks
- Creating reusable components for displaying complex data (user profiles, repositories)
- Handling error scenarios gracefully in API calls
- Implementing pagination and "View All" functionality for large datasets
- Working with Vite as a modern build tool with fast development server

### Useful resources

- [GitHub REST API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) - Official documentation for GitHub API endpoints used to fetch user and repository data
- [React Hooks Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react) - Essential for understanding useState and useEffect hooks used in this project
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - Helps understand type definitions and interfaces
- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool and development server used in this project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React 19](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed superset of JavaScript for better code quality
- [Vite 7](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next generation frontend build tool
- [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) - For fetching user and repository data

## Features

- **GitHub User Search** - Search and display any GitHub user's profile information
- **User Profile Display** - Shows user avatar, name, bio, followers, following count, and location
- **Repository Listing** - Displays user repositories with details including:
  - Repository name and description
  - Star count
  - Fork count
  - License information
  - Last update date
- **Sorted Repositories** - Repositories are sorted by most recently updated first
- **Repository Pagination** - View limited repositories initially with option to load all repositories
- **Responsive Design** - Fully responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile devices

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
